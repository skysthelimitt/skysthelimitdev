      <p>how (until august 21st 2023 (oh hey, my birthday :3)) my school leaked a bunch of staff and parent emails</p>
      <p>finally getting around to this, it should not have taken so long</p>
      <h2>backstory</h2>
      <p>i was always interested in trying to find exploits in my school, i always sucked at it though, rarely finding anything interesting, and mostly just fucking around and trying whatever</p>
      <p>somewhere, probably 7th grade, i had found this thing called google groups, never really looked through it though, i clicked around a few times. all i thought was "oh, it has some of my classes, thats kinda cool"</p>
      <h2>the actual story</h2>
      <p>so, it was a few weeks before my first ever day of high school, me being nervous and shit, i wanted to know what classes i got into. after racking my brain for a while, i thought of something, "oh, let's look at google groups, maybe that has something", turns out, it did have all of my classes (even though schedules were released a week later)</p>
      <p>since i had remembered google groups existed, i decided to explore a bit more, and clicked "all groups", which showed me a few things that looked interesting, but luckily, the school had set the permissions correctly, so you couldnt see anything</p>
      <p>as i continue looking, i realize, google groups handles emails, which makes me even more interested</p>
      <p>i continue scrolling through the list of email accounts, but i quickly realize its just thousands and thousands of auto-generated emails for classes, so i decide to search specific keywords like "admin" or "teacher", which is where shit hit the fan</p>
      <p>quickly, i find already thousands of emails, and i panic slightly, but i remember my schools open house (where you get to see the school and your classes) is in a few days, so i wait until then</p>
      <p>luckily, there was a table full of the IT people at my school, so i go up to them, "hey, i found an issue which is leaking a lot of private emails-" "yeah, we know, we're fixing it"</p>
      <p>huh? rude asf, but whatever, i assume they already knew, so i continue</p>
      <p>i continue checking over the next few days, but nothing. the issue is still there, and with this opportunity, i look deeper. i already had things that no student shouldve seen, but i kept looking anyways, and im glad i did.</p>
      <p>within days, i find the email for the welcome center, this handles kids who are moving into our district, which i quickly realized was a gold mine of incredibly personal information on minors, a lot of emails had full names, birthday, addresses, and after a little bit of looking, i found some kids birth certificate.</p>
      <p>i panic, realizing this issue just became a whole lot bigger, and quickly sent an email to the IT people of my school, not knowing who else to write to</p>
      <p>next day (aka the day before school started), i got a response, from none other than the district of technology, and it was finally fixed (they spelt my name wrong SOMEHOW, my name is simple, how tf do you misspell it)</p>
      <p>this was the story of how i (very simply) found a shit ton of emails</p>
